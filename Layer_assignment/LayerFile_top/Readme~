This program is the power density-aware FM based tier assignment.
The DIFFERENT to the other program is that it can set the power density constraint of the top tier.

Usage:
 ./run.sh <bench number> <mode> <top power density ratio>

"mode" is GSRC/Ibm benchmark, where GSRC is 0 and Ibm is 1
"bench number" denote the number in the name of benchmark.
"top power density ratio" should be set as a floating number which is between 0 to 1.
